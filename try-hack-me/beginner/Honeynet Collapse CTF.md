
General Approach for Honeynet Collapse CTF:
Since this appears to be a blue team/forensics challenge, here's how you should typically approach it:
1. Initial Assessment

Start by reading all the challenge descriptions carefully
Download any provided files (logs, pcaps, memory dumps, etc.)
Note any specific questions that need to be answered

2. Common Tools You'll Likely Need

Wireshark - for network traffic analysis
Volatility - for memory dump analysis
Log analysis tools - grep, awk, or specialized SIEM tools
Timeline analysis tools - for correlating events
Malware analysis tools - if malware samples are involved

3. Typical Investigation Steps

Network Analysis: Look for suspicious connections, data exfiltration, C2 communications
Log Analysis: Examine system logs, authentication logs, application logs
Timeline Creation: Correlate events across different log sources
Indicator Identification: Find IOCs (IPs, domains, file hashes, etc.)
Attack Vector Analysis: Determine how the compromise occurred

4. Key Areas to Investigate

Initial access methods
Lateral movement techniques
Persistence mechanisms
Data exfiltration activities
Command and control communications
